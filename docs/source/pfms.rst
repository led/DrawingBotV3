Path Finding Modules
#########################

The Path Finding Modules (PFMs) are algorithms for converting images into geometric shapes, they can be configured in the **Path Finding Controls** panel.
They have been designed to be as flexible as possible and to run with almost any combination of settings. This means that they can create many more styles than those you see here. Some of these extra styles are included as **presets**!

Every Path Finding Module can also be run with :ref:`cmyk-separation` and :ref:`colour-match`


***********************
Sketch PFMs
***********************

Sketch PFMs are best used for plots using multiple layers of different pens as the Sketch PFMs rely on the different pens to represent the different tones in the image. However, it is possible to use a single pen with Sketch PFMs though it is recommended to use a pen which is additive where overlapping strokes will result in progressively darker lines.

How do they work?
================================

1) Find the darkest area of the image
2) Find the darkest pixel in that area
3) Finds the next darkest line/curve from that pixel
4) Brighten the part of the image that the line covers
5) Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the specified :term:`Squiggle Max Length` is reached then return to step 1

The process will stop when either the specified :term:`Line Density` or :term:`Line Max Limit` has been reached.

Sketch Lines
======================
Transforms an image into lines using brightness data.

Default
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

    Plotting Resolution
    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.1 -> 1.0)``

        Controls the resolution of the image used by the PFM but doesn't change the size of the pen to be used, this is available on almost every PFM!

        This is a quick way to increase/decrease the visual quality & density of a drawing and also decrease computation time.

        .. image:: images/sketch/plotting_resolution_comparison_v1.jpg
            :height: 150pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Plotting Resolution = 0.2, Fig 2. Plotting Resolution = 0.4, Fig 3. Plotting Resolution = 0.7*

        **Quick Tip:** You can also enter values higher than the Safe Range, for example using (1.0 -> 1.5) may be enough to get the density you're aiming for

    Random Seed
        ``Values: Number``

        Used to generate all the random numbers used by the PFM. If you use the same Random Seed the PFM will produce the same results when given the same image.

        **Quick Tip:** Created a good style but the lines aren't falling in quite the right way? Adjust the random seed and to alter the positions of the generated lines.

----

Style
^^^^^^^^^^^

The style portion of the Sketch PFM settings are great for applying a specific creative style to the generated paths.
The majority of the style sliders affect the path processing only and not the original bitmap image.

The values don't need to add up 100% the balance between all of them decides the weighting of what to emphasise.
e.g :term:`Directionality` of 100% and a :term:`Luminance Power` of 100%, means that the paths will be 50% driven by the luminance of the image and 50% by the :term:`Directionality`.

.. glossary::

 Should Lift Pen
        ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

        When **True**, the pen will be lifted in-between Squiggles.

        When **False**, the PFM will never lift the pen from the paper.

 Directionality
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Forces the lines to follow the natural contours of the image by pushing the Path Finding process towards the direction of lowest variance.

        .. image:: images/style/directionality_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Directionality = 0, Fig 2. Directionality = 100 - You can see in this example the paths on the right tend to follow the curves of the original image more carefully and don't fall outside of the shapes as often*

 Clarity
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Controls a sharpness of the input image, and automatically applies an Unsharp Mask before processing the image.

        .. image:: images/style/clarity_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Clarity = 0, Fig 2. Clarity = 100*

 Distortion
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Adds some random noise to the generated lines, creating more stylised images.

        .. image:: images/style/distortion_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt


        *e.g. Fig 1. Distortion = 0, Fig 2. Distortion = 100*

 Angularity
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Controls the frequency at which lines are allowed to change direction, a higher angularity results in lines which don’t change direction as frequently and cut across the image in more stylised ways.

        .. image:: images/style/angularity_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Angularity = 0, Fig 2. Angularity = 50*

 Edge Power
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Pushes the Path Finding process to edges detected by Canny Edge Detection, which is very accurate and will highlight sharp edges, keeping more detail in the image.


        .. image:: images/style/edge_power_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Edge Power = 0, Fig 2. Edge Power = 100*

 Sobel Power
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Similar to Edge Power but uses a Sobel Edge Filter instead of Canny Edge Detection, which results in less accurate edges and creates an exaggerated cartoonish quality on the plot.


        .. image:: images/style/sobel_power_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 400pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Sobel Power = 0, Fig 2. Sobel Power = 100*

 Luminance Power
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Luminance Power is what typically drives the Path Finding Process so should usually be left at 100%, and the other style sliders should be introduced bit by bit.
        Typically PFMs will follow dark areas in the image when creating lines, this slider can be used to decrease the influence of brightness which in turn will favour other style options like Directionarity or Edge Power etc.

 Drawing Delta Angle
        ``Values: Number (Range: -360 -> 360)``

        Controls the directions that the PFM can travel during the Path Finding Process.

----

Segments
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

    Line Density
        ``Values: Percentage (Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Affects the total number of segments in the final drawing and therefore the computation time. This setting drives the progress bar and when it reaches 100% processing stops.

        :math:`progress = (avgLuminance - initialLuminance) / (desiredLuminance - initialLuminance)*lineDensity`

        **Quick Tip:** Reducing the Displayed Shapes slider above the viewport has the same effect as decreasing the :term:`Line Density`. So if the density is too high you can reduce it later.

    Line Min Length

        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 2 -> 500)``

        The minimum length of each segment, see :term:`Line Max Length` for more details.


    Line Max Length
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 2 -> 500)``

        The maximum length of each segment, :term:`Line Min Length` defines the minimum.

        Decreasing the Min/Max Length will increase the detail retention in the final plot as each segment will be more accurate.

        Increasing the Min/Max Length will increase the length of generated lines and decrease the accuracy of the final plot.


    Line Max Limit

        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: -1 -> 1000000)``

        Limits the total number of segments. Will only have an effect if this limit is reached before the chosen :term:`Line Density`.

        When the Max Limit is -1, the limit will be ignored.

    Angle Tests

        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 360)``

        Controls the accuracy of the generated lines. When finding the next segment the PFM will generate new segments travelling in different directions and then compare them. The Angle Tests controls the number of new segments to generate at each position.

        **Quick Tip:** This control can also be used creatively, try setting it to 3, 4 or 6. You'll see the PFM generate Triangles, Squares and Hexagonal Lines.

    Unlimited Tests
        ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

        Will run as many angle tests as required to find the “best” line possible, resulting in more accurate drawings with longer processing times.

----

Squiggles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A path of segments(lines/curves) is called a squiggle. Each squiggle is continuous and doesn't include any pen lifts.

You can use this area of the PFM to reduce the plotting time of sketches generated but at the trade-off of losing smaller details and potentially having squiggles crossing bright areas of the source image.

Shorter Squiggles = Longer Plotting Time & Higher Quality Output
Longer Squiggles = Shorter Plotting & Lower Quality Output

.. glossary::

    Squiggle Min Length
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 5000)``

        Defines the minimum number of segments for each squiggle, setting a minimum length prevents incredibly short squiggles from being created, shortening plotting times.

        e.g. Squiggle Min Length = 100, every squiggle would consist of at least 100+ segments.

    Squiggle Max Length
        ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 5000)``

        Defines the cut-off for the maximum number of segments allowed in each squiggle. Once the squiggle has reached the max length the pen will be lifted and move to a new location.

        Increasing the Max Length will decrease the plotting time, but may create a poor distribution of tones.

    Squiggle Max Deviation

        ``Values: Percentage (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Control how far a squiggle is allowed to deviate in brightness before it is ended prematurely. This has the result of making shorter squiggles which are more accurate and less likely to cross over brighter areas of the image. Increasing the allowed deviation will result in a less accurate drawing with fewer pen lifts.

        If you notice your drawing has lines crossing bright areas of the image that you wish to remove, you can try lowering the Max Deviation and lowering the Squiggle Min Length.

        .. image:: images/sketch/squiggle_deviation_comparison.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Squiggle Max Deviation = 5, Fig 2. Squiggle Max Deviation = 1000 - The green lines show the plotter's travel while the pen is up. The overall distance of the plot changed by a few metres, and the number of pen lifts was dramatically reduced. The default Squiggle Max Deviation of 25 provides a good middle-ground, keeping quality while not having too many pen lifts.*

----

Erasing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sketch PFMs use a Lightened Image to keep track of the areas which have been drawn over. When a line is drawn it is erased from the Working Image, so when the same area is next considered, lines will be less likely to cross over.

You can view the Lightened Image in your viewport by going to "Display / Lightened" after the drawing has finished processing.

    .. image:: images/sketch/erase_drawing_comparison_v1.jpg
        :width: 500pt

    *e.g. Fig 1. Original Image, Fig 2. Lightened/Erased Image, Fig 3. Sketch Lines Result*


.. glossary::

    Erase Min

        ``Values: Number (Range: 0 -> 255)``

        Controls the minimum intensity of the __`Erasing` process, see :term:`Erase Max` for more details.

    Erase Max

        ``Values: Number (Range: 0 -> 255)``

        Controls the maximum intensity of the __`Erasing` process, with :term:`Erase Min` defining the minimum.

        The Erase Min/Max alters the amount to brighten each RGB channel in the Lightened Image.

        It therefore controls the overall plot density & contrast in the image and can be fine-tuned to your specific pens.

        The :term:`Tone` setting alters the interpolation between these two values.

        .. image:: images/sketch/erase_max_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Erase Min = 50 & Erase Max = 50, Fig 2. Erase Min = 50 & Erase Max = 125 (Default), Fig 3. Erase Min = 50 & Erase Max = 255*

        **Quick Tip:** Are your Physical Plots coming out too dense and soaking the paper?

        Try increasing the Erase Min/Max to reduce the amount of overlap.

    Erase Radius Min

        ``Values: Number (Range: 0 -> 50)``

        Controls the minimum radius of the shapes drawn by the __`Erasing` process, see :term:`Erase Radius Max` for more details.


    Erase Radius Max
        ``Values: Number (Range: 0 -> 50)``

        Controls the maximum radius of the __`Erasing` process, with :term:`Erase Radius Min` defining the minimum.

        It therefore controls the spread of shapes in the image and the overall plot density.

        The :term:`Tone` setting alters the interpolation between these two values.

        **Quick Tip:** Are you wanting to plot with a single pen? Increasing the Erase Radius Max is a great way to introduce contrast back into the drawing.

        .. image:: images/sketch/erase_radius_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Original Image, Fig 2. Lightened/Erased Image, Fig 3. Sketch Lines Result - The "Digital" Preset was used with Erase Min = 1, Erase Max = 24*


    Tone
        ``Values: Percentage (Range: 0 -> 100)``

        Controls the contrast of the _`Erasing` process, by controlling a tone curve between the :term:`Erase Min` / :term:`Erase Max`  & :term:`Erase Radius Min` / :term:`Erase Radius Max`.

        Using a higher Tone will result in an image with a stronger contrast, with more overlap and less spacing between lines.

        Note: The tone slider has no effect when the Erase Values are identical.

        .. image:: images/sketch/erase_tone_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Tone=0, Fig 2. Tone=50, Fig 3. Tone=100 - The "Sketchy" Preset was used with Erase Min=50, Erase Max=125, Erase Radius Min=1.0, Erase Radius Max=6.0*


        **Quick Tip:** Use a tone of 100 when using a high :term:`Erase Radius Max`, to bring some detail back into the image

----

Shading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. glossary::

    Shading
        ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

        When **True**, shading segments will be drawn across the drawing which can only travel in the direction defined by the Start Angle Min & Max

    Start Angle Min

        ``Values: Number (Range: -360 -> 360)``

        Controls the minimum angle when shading, see :term:`Start Angle Max` for more details.

    Start Angle Max

        ``Values: Number (Range: -360 -> 360)``

        Controls the maximum angle when __`Shading`, effectively changing the direction of the __`Shading` Process, it will have less effect when __`Shading` is disabled unless the :term:`Drawing Delta Angle` isn't set to 360, then the angle of the start angle will be more obvious.

        .. image:: images/sketch/shading_angle_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Start Angle Min = -72, Max = -52, Fig 2. Start Angle Min = -85, Max = 95, Fig 3. Start Angle Min = 0, Max = 0 - created with the "Default" preset with Shading = True, Shading Threshold = 0*


    Shading Threshold
        ``Values: Percentage (Range: 0 -> 100)``

        The point in the processing when the shading process will begin, effectively controlling the percentage of the drawing which is created from the shading process.

        Note: It ignores :term:`Line Density`, so if the limit is reached before the shading threshold is reached no shading will be seen.


        .. image:: images/sketch/shading_comparison_v1.jpg
            :width: 500pt

        *e.g. Fig 1. Shading=False, Fig 2. Shading=True, Shading Threshold=50, Fig 3. Shading=True, Shading Threshold=100*

    Shading Delta Angle
        ``Values: Number (Range: -360 -> 360)``

        Controls the directions that the PFM can travel during the Shading Process.

        Changing this will result in much more "Glitchy" results, and is especially good for digital art!

Sketch Quad Beziers
======================
Transforms an image into `Quadratic Bézier curves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Quadratic_B%C3%A9zier_curves>`_ using brightness data, by first finding the darkest line and then finding the darkest position for one control point. It uses more accurate "Bresenham" calculations which results in longer processing times but increased precision.

Settings
------------------

Curves (Quad Beziers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. glossary::

    Curve Tests

        ``Values: Number (Range: 1 -> 45)``

        the number of positions to test for each control point to find the darkest curve. Increasing this will result in a more accurate plot.

    Curve Variation

        ``Values: Number (Range: 1 -> 1000)``

        the maximum magnitude of the curve, increasing this will decrease the test accuracy and increase the control point's offsets.


    Curve Offset

        ``Values: Number (Range: -100 -> 100)``

        Allow you to control the ‘wiggle’ of the curve by defining the maximum offset the control's points can move from the initial segment.

        For _`Sketch Quad Beziers`, this is a single control which controls the variation of the central point of each quad segment.

        For _`Sketch Cubic Beziers`, this is an A & B Offset which each control the variation of the A & B control points on the cubic segment.

***********************
Spiral PFMS
***********************

Spiral PFMs are suitable for plots with a single pen, and can generate spirals which are continuous without any pen lifts.

With a small Ring Spacing they can also be very accurate and represent small details in the original image.


How they work
======================
1) Moves to the first point on the spiral.
2) Samples the brightness at the current point and draws a line which is perpendicular to the spiral where the line's length is proportional to the sampled brightness.
3) Move to the next point on the spiral and Repeat step 2.

The process stops when the specified :term:`Spiral Size` has been reached

Default Spiral Settings
--------------------------

Spiral
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Spiral Type
    ``Values: Archimedean | Parabolic``

    Changes the style of the generated Spiral

    - **Archimedean:** a single spiral
    - **Parabolic:** two connected spirals, this can be used for creating a spiral out of two different pens. Change your Distribution Type to "Preconfigured" after processing has finished.

 Spiral Size

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Alters where the generated spiral will end. A spiral at 100% will always reach the corner of the image.

    **Quick Tip:** You can adjust the Spiral Size after the drawing has been generated with the Shapes Slider.

 Centre X/Y

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Controls the centre position the spiral starts from as percentages relative to the images width/height.

    e.g. Left = 0, Middle = 50, Right = 100

 Ring Spacing

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 50)``

    The distance between each generated ring, which also has the effect of increasing the width of the rings as the :term:`Amplitude (Spiral PFMs)` is proportional to the Ring Spacing.

    A lower Ring Spacing will resolve more detail from the original image.


 Amplitude (Spiral PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.01 -> 2.0)``

    Controls the scaling of the lines/shapes generated along the spiral. It is proportional to the **Ring Spacing**

    :math:`finalWidth = ringSpacing * (amplitude)`


 Variable Velocity

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the velocity will vary between the Min & Max proportionally to the image's luminance.

    When **False**, the Min Velocity will always be used.

 Min/Max Velocity (Spiral PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1.0 -> 360.0)``

    Controls the frequency of shapes along the spiral. Lower velocities will result in more shapes, higher will result in less.

    The velocity variables should be used to adjust the overall contrast of the spiral (adding a contrast filter in Image Processing is a good place to start too)

    - Higher velocity = less shapes generated, lower plotting time. High values will result in more inconsistent results as the spiral generation may skip of key areas of the image.
    - Lower velocity = more shapes generated, higher plotting time. More accurate to the original image.

    :math:`velocity = minVelocity + sineFunction(luminance) * (maxVelocity-minVelocity)`


 Ignore White (Spiral PFMs)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, if the spiral reaches a white pixel in the source image the spiral will not be drawn.

    When **False**, the spiral will draw over the entire image up to the Spiral Size.

Hatch PFMs generate a set of lines across the image and then use different styles to turn these lines into waves/scribbles whose width matches the luminance at a given point.

They are suitable for plots with a Single Pen and similarly to Spiral PFMs can generate continuous hatched lines across the drawing which don't require any pen lifts.

***********************
Adaptive PFMS
***********************

'Adaptive' are named after the way they adapt to match the tone of the input image.

The reproduction of tones is considerably more accurate than other PFMs as they have an additional "Tone Mapping" processing stage. This process only needs to be performed once per configuration of settings. If you change a setting which could alter the tone map it will generated again.

You can view the output of the tone mapping stage by selecting "Display:" and then "Tone Map". This shows you three outputs; the Reference Tone Map, the drawing created by the PFM with the current settings and the blurred version of this output.

Adaptive PFMs are suitable for Single Pen Plots or Multi Colour Plots

**For the best results with Adaptive PFMs use high resolution, high contrast images**

How do they work?
======================================
1) Generate a Tone Map using steps 2 to 3, analyse the result then create a new input image which will result in drawing with a more accurate representation of the original tones.
2) Create evenly distributed points across the image based on brightness.
3) Generate the specific style based on these points.

Adaptive Sampling
---------------------

.. glossary::

 Min/Max Sample Radius (Adaptive PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.1 -> 100.0)``

    Controls the distribution of the generated points, controlling the contrast and detail present in the final image.

    In general keeping Min Sample Radius < 2 and changing the Max Sample Radius will provide the best results with more Adaptive PFMs.

    Unlike LBG & Voronoi, Adaptive PFMs follow the sample sizes strictly and place points evenly across the entire image and produce a consistent looking drawing.

 Brightness (Adaptive PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 2.0)``

    Controls the brightness applied as a pre-processing step to the source image, see :term:`Contrast (Adaptive PFMs)`.


 Contrast (Adaptive PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 2.0)``

    Controls the contrast applied as a pre-processing step to the source image.

    The quality of Drawings from Adaptive PFMs rely massively on contrast and brightness so these controls are included for simplicity, though they behave the same as adding a contrast filter in the Pre-Processing tab.


 Ignore White (Adaptive PFMs)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, points will not be placed in the white areas of the image.

Circular Scribbles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These settings are shared by  _`Spiral Circular Scribbles`, _`Adaptive Circular Scribbles` and _`LBG Circular Scribbles`

.. glossary::

 Min/Max Radius (Circular Scribbles)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.1 -> 128)``

    Controls the radius of the generated Circular Loops which make up the scribble. The radius will vary across the drawing based on the image's *luminance*.

    :math:`radius = minRadius + (luminance * (maxRadius-minRadius))`

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_radius_increase.png

    *e.g - Circular Scribble varying from Min Radius to Max Radius*


 Min/Max Velocity (Circular Scribbles)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.1 -> 128)``

    Controls the min/max velocity of the generated Circular Scribbles, in other words this controls the frequency of circular loops in the final scribble.
    The radius will vary across the drawing based on the image's *luminance*.

    :math:`velocity = minVelocity + (luminance * (maxVelocity-minVelocity))`

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_velocity_increase.png

    *e.g - Circular Scribble varying from Min Velocity to Max Velocity*

 Angular Velocity

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.1 -> 180)``

    Controls the speed of rotation of the scribbles, low angular velocity will result in fewer loops, higher velocity will result in more loops.
    Generally the angular velocity should be at least double the maximum velocity if you wish the scribbles to always create loops.
    In general the default is good, but it can be useful to adjust it slightly for some images.

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_angular_velocity_10.png

    *e.g. Angular Velocity = 10*

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_angular_velocity_40.png

    *e.g. Angular Velocity = 40*

 Azimuth Angle Min/Max

    ``Values: Number (Range: -180 -> 180)``

    Controls the pitch of the circular scribbles, resulting in a slanting effect.
    Note: If you wish to introduce a regular slant keep the min/max the same.

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_azimuth_45.png

    *e.g. Azimuth Angle Min = 45 & Azimuth Angle Max = 45*

 Polar Angle Min/Max

    ``Values: Number (Range: -180 -> 180)``

    Controls the yaw of the circular scribbles, resulting in closing/widening the circular loops
    Note: Similarly to Polar Angle, keeping the values the same will result in a consistent style.

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_polar_45.png

    *e.g. Polar Angle Min = 45 & Polar Angle Max = 45*

 Curvature (Circular Scribbles)

    ``Values: Number (Range: 0 -> 1)``

    Controls the interpolation between scribble points, 0 = Straight Lines -> 1 = Smooth Curves

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_curvature_0.png

    *e.g. Curvature = 0*

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_curvature_1.png

    *e.g. Curvature = 1*


 Edge Retention

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the radius of Circular Scribbles will be adapted to prevent them from overlapping the detected edges in the image, resulting in more detail being retained in the final drawing.

    Set the Edge Threshold A & B, to alter the number of edges detected.

    .. image:: images/circularscribbles/circular_scribbles_edge_retention_comparison.jpg

    *Comparison: Fig 1. Original Image, Fig 2. Default Settings, Fig 3. Default Settings w/ Edge Retention=True*


 Edge Threshold A & B

    ``Values: Number (Range: 1F -> 255F)``

    These thresholds are used by the internal Canny Edge Detector to filter out the target edges. Raising the threshold will reduce the effect of the edge retention.

    From the `OpenCV documentation <https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html>`_

        a) If a pixel gradient is higher than the upper threshold, the pixel is accepted as an edge
        b) If a pixel gradient value is below the lower threshold, then it is rejected.
        c) If the pixel gradient is between the two thresholds, then it will be accepted only if it is connected to a pixel that is above the upper threshold.

    Canny recommended an upper:lower ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.

***********************
Voronoi PFMs
***********************

All Voronoi PFMs utilise a `Weighted Voronoi Diagram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Voronoi_diagram>`_ to determine the distribution of brightness in the original image and then use this diagram to generate new styles.

How do they work?
======================================
1) Randomly scatter points over the image proportional to the images brightness
2) Calculates a voronoi diagram based on these points.
3) Calculates the weighted centroids of each cell in the diagram using brightness data.
4) Use the generated centroids to re-calculate the voronoi diagram.
5) Return to step 3

The process finishes when the specified number of **voronoi iterations** have been performed.

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 1000000)``

    Controls a hard limit for the amount of points to be generated. Only has an effect if the the number is lower than the amount that would be generated by the given Point Density
    The limit will be ignored when set to 0.

 Luminance Power (Voronoi PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 50)``

    Used when randomly scattering points over the image, it affects how biased the scattering is towards darker areas of the image, typically using the same value for Density Power yields the best results.

 Density Power

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 50)``

    Used when calculating the centroids of the voronoi diagram, it affects the calculation's bias towards darker areas of the image, typically using the same value for Luminance Power yields the best results.

 Voronoi Iterations

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 100)``

    How many times to re-calculate the voronoi diagram. More iterations will result in a more accurate representation of the original image.

 Voronoi Accuracy

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 100)``

    Controls the quality of the voronoi calculation, decreases processing times.

 Ignore White (Voronoi PFMs)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the PFM will filter out points in white areas of the image.

********************
Grid PFMS
********************

Grid PFMs create styles using a grid, great for creating some classic half-tone drawing styles but also much more stylised drawings where the grid is only a starting point and the points may diverge away from it.

They work especially well with :ref:`cmyk-separation` and :ref:`colour-match`

They also process very quickly due to the simplicity of generating the starting grid.

**Quick Tip:** Grid PFMs often work better with thicker pens 0.5mm + as this helps to introduce contrast to the grid.


Default Grid PFM Settings
===================================

Grid
----------------

.. glossary::

 Uniform Spacing

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the Grid Spacing will be the same on both the X & Y Axis and the :term:`Grid Y Spacing` variable will be locked.

    When **False**, the :term:`Grid X Spacing` and :term:`Grid Y Spacing` can be different.

 Grid X Spacing

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1.0 -> 32.0)``

    Controls the number of columns in the grid.

 Grid Y Spacing

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1.0 -> 32.0)``

    Controls the number of rows in the grid, only usable if :term:`Uniform Spacing` is **False**.

 Shape Scale

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.01 -> 4.0)``

    Controls the shape of the generated Shapes, a value of 1.0 will occupy all the available space in the grid.

    Values higher than 1.0 will use more than the available space and cause shapes to overlap.

    Values lower than 1.0 will use less than the available space.

 Rand Offset X/Y

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 64.0)``

    Introduces a random X/Y offset to each grid position, introducing some natural noise to the grid.

    With values higher than 0, the grid positions will no longer be uniform.

 Interleave

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, every odd row will be offset by the grid spacing, creating interlocking grid points.

    When **False**, the grid will be uniform.


Grid Style
----------------

.. glossary::

 Brightness (Grid PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 2.0)``

    Controls the brightness applied as a pre-processing step to the source image, see :term:`Brightness (Adaptive PFMs)`

 Contrast (Grid PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 2.0)``

    Controls the contrast applied as a pre-processing step to the source image.

    The quality of Drawings from Grid PFMs can vary massively on the contrast and brightness so these controls are included for simplicity though they behave the same as adding a contrast filter in the Pre-Processing tab.


 Threshold (Grid PFMs)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 100.0)``

    Controls the cut-off luminance to stop generating grid points. Lowering the Threshold will prevent points being drawn in bright areas of the image.

 Threshold Feather

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0.0 -> 100.0)``

    Controls a dithering process applied when a Threshold has been introduced.

    When the Feather is 0 the threshold will be a hard cut-off, due to the linear nature of the grid this can become quite obvious with some settings / image combinations.

    In these situations introducing a feather will add some randomness to if points are drawn or not, resulting in more gradual cut-off.

 Concentric Fills

    **(Grid Shapes / Letters Only)**

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the generated shapes will be filled entirely with the pen, a continuous fill consisting of progressively smaller shapes will be generated, this is useful for introducing some more tone/contrast into the final drawing.

    When **False**, no fills will be generated.

    .. image:: images/grids/concentric_fills_comparison_v1.jpg
        :width: 300pt

 Convergence

    ``Values: Percentage (Range: 0.0 -> 100.0)``

    Causes grid points to converge towards the darkest areas of the image making the grid no longer uniform but having the effect of emphasising edges and contrast in the image.

    This is great for creating stylised results and is used in many of the default grid presets.

    .. image:: images/grids/convergence_comparison_v1.jpg

********************
Composite PFMS
********************

Composite PFMs offer different ways to combine multiple PFMs together to create new styles.

Default Composite PFM Settings
===================================

Drawing Styles
----------------

.. glossary::

 Drawing Styles

    ``Values: Special``

    A configurable list of Drawing Styles.

    A **Drawing Style** consists of a Path Finding Module and a Drawing Set. When run the PFM will be run with the given Drawing Set and added to the final drawing.

    Upon clicking the "Drawing Styles" button in the PFM Settings you'll be presented with this window.

    .. image:: images/composite/drawing_styles_ui.png
        :width: 300pt

    Here you can configure the Composite PFM's enabled Drawing Styles. You may add as many Styles as you wish and by selecting each one in the list on the left of the window you can configure the settings of the Path Finding Module on the right.

    - *Name*
        Defaults to the selected PFM, but can be changed by the user.

    - *Weight*
        *Only visible for specific Composite PFMs*

        Typically the selection of PFMs for the various tiles of the mosaic is random and the random selections can be changed with the :term:`Random Seed`.

        However, when the weight is changed, the random selection will be weighted (similar to pen weights) and the number of tiles in the mosaic drawn in that style will be proportional to its weight.

    - *Drawing Set:*
        The selected Drawing Set. Change it by double clicking the current value. To create more Drawing Sets see **Drawing Slots** at the bottom of the Pen Settings tab.

    Note: It's also possible to stack multiple composite PFMs inside each other, when Composite PFMs are stacked selecting the "Drawing Styles" button will open another identical window, but the title of the window will change, indicating where in the chain of PFMs you currently are. This should be considered an Experimental feature and may result in crashes due to the complexity of deep stacks of mosaic pfms.


 Draw Outlines

    **(for Mosaic PFMs only)**

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the shapes used to generate the mosaic will also be output as Shapes, giving each Mosaic Cell/Tile a sharp outline.

----

Mosaic Rectangles
======================================
Divides an image into a series of rectangles which can are then distributed randomly amongst the enabled Drawing Styles

.. image:: images/pfms/mosaic_rectangles_1.jpg
    :width: 300pt

Settings
----------

Tiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Square Tiles

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, instead of rectangles the PFM will only produce Squares, the row & row padding sliders will be disabled.


 Columns

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 64)``

    Controls the number of columns along the x axis and therefore affects the total number of tiles in the mosaic.


 Rows

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 64)``

    Controls the number of rows along the y axis and therefore affects the total number of tiles in the mosaic.

 Column Padding %

    ``Values: Percentage (Range: 1 -> 100)``

    Controls the border of the rectangle on the left and right as a percentage of the tiles width.


 Row Padding %

    ``Values: Percentage (Range: 1 -> 100)``

    Controls the border of the rectangle on the top and bottom as a percentage of the tiles height.

----

Mosaic Voronoi
======================================
Divides an image into a Voronoi Diagram, each cell is distributed randomly amongst the enabled Drawing Styles.

.. image:: images/pfms/mosaic_voronoi_1.jpg
    :width: 300pt

Settings
----------

Tiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Tile Count (Mosaic Voronoi)
    ``Values: Number (Range: -20 -> 20)``

    Controls the number of Voronoi Tiles to generate / how many times to split the input image.

 Offset Cells
    ``Values: Percentage (Range: -20 -> 20)``

    Shifts the border of the generated Voronoi Tiles. Negative values will shrink the cell, positive values will grow the cell.
    Note: Negative values may result in nothing being drawn in cells if they become too small.

Mosaic Triangulation
======================================

----

Mosaic Segments
======================================

Generates a mosaic out of detailed segments using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC Image Segmentation), the shapes it generates represent the shapes present in the original drawing much more accurately that Mosaic Voronoi.

Generating accurate segments means this PFM will pause for up to 20 seconds before processing.

    :width: 300pt


Settings
----------

Segments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Segments
    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 5000)``

    Controls the total number of segments to generate with SLIC Image Segmentation. Higher values will take longer to process and may crash for certain images / computers.

 Iterations
    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 100)``

    Controls the accuracy of the SLIC Image Segmentation, more iterations = longer processing time, more accurate segments.

 Compactness
    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 100)``

    Adjusts the outline of the segments generated, high values = flatter cells, formed of straight lines, low values = messy cells, with rough outlines

Layers PFM
======================================

Layers all of the Drawing Styles on top of each other, with each Style being run once and covering the entire image.

The Drawing Styles are layered in the order they are listed in the Drawing Styles menu.

.. image:: images/pfms/layers_pfm_1.jpg
    :width: 300pt


Settings
----------

Layers
^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Keep Lightened Image

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, the Layers PFM will take the *Lightened Image* (see __`Erasing` for more details) at each stage in the plotting process and pass it onto the next PFM.

    The *Lightened Image* is typically only used by Sketch PFMs, , so if you are layering multiple Sketch PFMs enabling this option will limit the amount of overlap as each Sketch PFM will essentially start where the last finished. If you have other types of PFMs layered after a Sketch PFM with **Keep Lightened Image** enabled their outputs will also be affected.



 Layer Distribution

    ``Values: NONE | ORDERED PER PFM | ORDERED``

    Which allows finer control over the distribution of pens between layers
        - **NONE:** Layers will be distributed separately.
        - **ORDERED PER PFM:** Layers which use the same PFM and Drawing Set will be distributed together, treating the first layer as the darkest and the last layer as the brightest.
        - **ORDERED:** Same as the above, but only distributes matches Drawing Sets and ignores the used PFM.

 Draw Edges

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    Disables/Enables edge detection.

 Edge Blur

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 50)``

    Affects the pre-filter blur applied before edges are detected. Higher edge blur will result in less edges but the edges will be smoother.

 Edge Detail

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 255)``

    Controls the amount of edges which are generated: lower detail -> less edges : higher detail -> more edges.

 Edge Simplify

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Simplifies the generated edges, removing unnecessary vertices.

 Edge Distortion

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Introduces noise to the generated edges, giving them a rougher more inaccurate appearance.


Contours
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Draw Contours

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    Disables/Enables contour detection.

 Contour Blur

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 99)``

    Similar to Edge Blur but for contours. Has a greater impact on the amount of contours and quality of the contours.

 Contour Detail

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 255)``

    Controls the amount of contours which are generated: lower detail -> less contours : higher detail -> more contours.

 Contour Simplify

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Simplifies the generated contours, removing unnecessary vertices.

 Contour Distortion

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Introduces noise to the generated contours, giving them a rougher more inaccurate appearance.

Shading (ECS Drawing)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 Draw Shading

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    Disables/Enables shading. The shading component uses a simplified version of the Sketch Lines shading feature, you may choose to disable the shading entirely and overlay another Sketch PFM using PFM Layers.

 Shading Accuracy

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Controls the accuracy of the shading: lower -> less accurate, more stylised : higher -> more accurate, less stylised

 Shading Detail

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 100)``

    Controls the luminance at which shading will be stopped: lower -> less shading : higher -> more shading

 Shading Length

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 150)``

    Controls the maximum length of the lines which make up the shading.

SVG Converter
======================================

.. image:: images/pfms/svg_converter_1.jpg
    :width: 300pt


Settings
----------

Shape
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

 SVG Path

    ``Values: SVG File Path``

    The path to the SVG to be used. If this isn't set it will use the current imported SVG, if there isn't one the PFM will produce no output. You can use this PFM as part of a Layers PFM, to layer SVGs together, when you run the PFM like this you can set the SVG Path to use an SVG which hasn't been imported.

 Shape Clipping

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When enabled Solid Shapes will "clip" the shapes below, meaning if a shape is covered by another in the SVG only the visible part will be drawn, this only occurs for solid shapes, individual lines won't clip the shapes below.

 Derive Drawing Set

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When **True**, a new Drawing Pen will be generated for each colour in the SVG, allowing you to access them each as layers. This opens up possibilities for splitting SVGs by colour using a per/layer export, or even re-assigning colours to your SVG, once the SVG Converter PFM has been run you'll have access to change the colour of lines with all the tools available with a default drawing.


Hatch Fill
^^^^^^^^^^^

If shapes in the SVG have solid fills, hatch fills will be used instead which can easily be drawn by a pen plotter


.. glossary::

 Shape Filling (Hatch Fill)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    When enabled Hatch Fills will be generated.

 Spacing (Hatch Fill)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 1 -> 10)``

    The distance between the hatch lines. This is relative to the pen width so a spacing of 1.0 will draw over the entire shape with no gaps, a spacing of 2.0 will leave spaces the same width as the pen.

 Min/Max Rotation (Hatch Fill)

    ``Values: Number (Safe Range: 0 -> 360)``

    Controls the rotation of the generated hatch lines

 Link Ends (Hatch Fill)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    Links the resulting hatch lines to create one continuous line (for some shapes this may not always be possible)

 Crosshatch (Hatch Fill)

    ``Values: Boolean (True | False)``

    Creates an additional set of perpendicular Hatch Lines
